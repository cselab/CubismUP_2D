INTRODUCTION

  This is fpzip 1.0.1, a C++ library for lossless or lossy compression
  of 2D or 3D floating-point scalar fields.  fpzip was written by Peter
  Lindstrom at LLNL, and is based on the algorithm described in the
  following paper:

    Peter Lindstrom and Martin Isenburg
    "Fast and Efficient Compression of Floating-Point Data"
    IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,
      12(5):1245-1250, September-October 2006.

  For information on the API, usage, and licensing, please see the header
  file inc/fpzip.h.

INSTALLATION

  The library has been written for Linux, but will probably compile on most
  other platforms.  To compile the library, type:

    cd src
    make

  There is an example program in the examples subdirectory that compresses
  and decompresses multidimensional arrays of single- or double-precision
  floating-point scalar fields.  The example is meant to illustrate how to
  use the fpzip API, and can also be used to validate correct functionality
  of the library.  If the program fails, please consult examples/README and
  the Makefiles under examples and src for compile-time macros that may fix
  the problem.

REVISIONS

  fpzip 1.0.1, August 7, 2008

    - Added modes for bitwise type conversions beyond reinterpret_cast,
      which caused aliasing problems with gcc 4.1.2.

  fpzip 1.0.0, March 20, 2008

    - Initial release.
