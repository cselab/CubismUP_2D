This example program shows how to use the fpzip library.  The program can
be compiled for single- or double-precision data (see the Makefile).  The
usage is:

  testfpzip <infile> <nx> [ny [nz [nf [outfile]]]]

where nx, ny, and nz specify the size of a 3D array

  f[nz][ny][nx]

and nf specifying the number of contiguous scalar fields in the file.

To run the program on the single-precision example data set:

  testfpzip float16x16x16x1 16 16 16 1 output.fpz

Alternatively, one may consider compressing this 3D scalar field as a stack
of 2D fields:

  testfpzip float16x16x16x1 16 16 1 16 output.fpz

or as a single 1D field:

  testfpzip float16x16x16x1 4096 1 1 1 output.fpz

As expected, compression usually degrades with lower dimensionality.  The
output file is an optional argument.
