** fpzip version 1.0.1, August 7, 2008
** Part of the LOCAL Toolkit, UCRL-CODE-232243
** Written by Peter Lindstrom, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
**
**
**                               SUMMARY
**
** fpzip is a library for lossless or lossy compression of 2D and 3D
** arrays of single- or double-precision floating-point scalars.
** Although linear (1D) streams of scalars may be compressed as well,
** the algorithm has primarily be designed to exploit higher-dimensional
** structure in the data, and may not perform well on 1D data.  The
** library supports compression to either a file or to main memory, and
** allows specifying how many bits of precision to retain.  (Currently
** the precision is limited to 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits for floats and
** 16, 32, 48, or 64 bits for doubles.)  The decompressed data is
** returned in full precision, possibly with the least significant bits
** zeroed.  Because floating-point arithmetic may be affected by factors
** such as register precision, rounding mode, and compiler optimizations,
** precautions have been taken to ensure correctness and portability via
** a set of compile-time switches.  For example, it is possible to specify
** that floating-point operations be emulated via integer arithmetic, or to
** treat the binary representation of floating-point numbers as integers.
** Please consult the Makefile for choosing among these settings.  The
** compressor works correctly on the IEEE 754 floating-point format,
** though no particular assumption is made on the floating-point
** representation other than the most significant bit being the sign bit.
** Special values such as infinities, NaNs, and denormalized numbers
** should be handled correctly by the compressor.
**
** fpzip was developed as part of the LOCAL LDRD project at LLNL, and may
** be freely used and distributed for noncommercial purposes.  The core
** library is written in C++ and applications need to be linked with a
** C++ linker.  The library can, however, be called from C and FORTRAN.
** For further information and bug reports, please e-mail pl@llnl.gov.
